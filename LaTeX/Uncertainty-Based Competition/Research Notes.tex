\section{Uncertainty-Based Competition Between Prefrontal and Dorsolateral Striatal Systems for Behavioural Control}
	
	\subsection{Document Overview}

		This article by Daw, Niv \& Dayan is based on the idea that ``neural systems, notably prefrontal cortex, the striatum and their dopaminergic afferents, are thought to contribute to the selection of actions'' \parencite{Daw}

		When these systems disagree, the different neurological structures compete with each other, which is modelled here using a ``Bayesian principle of arbitration between them according to uncertainty, so each controller is deployed when it should be most accurate''. \parencite{Daw}


\subsection{The Dorsolateral Striatum}

	It is stated that ``the dorsolateral striatum and its dopaminergic afferents support habitual or reflexive control'' \parencite{Daw}

\subsection{The Prefrontal Cortex}
	
	The prefrontal cortex is said to be ``associated with more reflective or cognitive action planning'' \parencite{Daw} along with additional regions which are excluded for simplicity in this article.

\subsection{Outcome Re-valuation}
	
	Conditioning studies where the subject learns desirable behaviour through rewards and/or punishments can have their reward values unexpectedly changed in order to differentiate between two control systems. ``Outcome re-valuation affects the two styles of control differently and allows investigation of the characteristics of each controller, its neural substrates and the circumstances under which it dominates'' \parencite{Daw}
