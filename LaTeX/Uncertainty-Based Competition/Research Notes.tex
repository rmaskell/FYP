\section{Uncertainty-Based Competition Between Prefrontal and Dorsolateral Striatal Systems for Behavioural Control}
	\subsection{Document Overview}
		This article by Daw, Niv & Dayan assumes that we possess different neurological systems used for behavioural choice, one associated with the prefrontal cortex (which is said to make use of past experience) and another with the dorsolateral striatum 
		\textbf{(which is said to be more simplistic?????)}.
		When these systems disagree, the different neurological structures compete with each other which is modelled using a "Bayesian principle of arbitration between them according to uncertainty, so each controller is deployed when it should be most accurate".
